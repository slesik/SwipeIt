# **Swipe It!**

**SWIPE IT!** is an iOS quiz application (*a "True"/ "False" type game*) inspired by an online course from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com) online education platform.

The main goal of this game is to get 10 right answers in less than 100 seconds (every question has a time limit of 10 seconds).

This application is responsive on iPhone/iPad (landscape & portrait).
